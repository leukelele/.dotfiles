  summary: 'The fast mamba solver, now in conda!'
  description: |
    The conda-libmamba-solver is a new solver for the conda package manager
    which uses the solver from the mamba project behind the scenes,
    while carefully implementing conda's functionality and expected behaviors on top.
    The library used by mamba to do the heavy-lifting is called libsolv.
