## Background Information (for myself)
**What is a symlink?** Short for Symbolic Link. It is a file that points to another file or folder located somewhere else on your system. The changes made to one file with appear on the other. The command for creating a symlink is

```bash
ln -s target_path link path
```

The command allows the flexibility of saving application configurationss, which may then be transferred over to a new system.

## Changelog
